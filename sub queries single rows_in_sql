                               SUB QUERYS 
                            ===============
          Query within another query is called as Subquery or Nested query.
Subquerys are used to retrieve data from single or multiple tables by using
more than one step process. 


     All relational databases having two types of subquerys.
These are.

   1)Non Correlated subquerys
   2)Correlated subquerys


   In Non corelated subquery child query is executed first then
only parent query is executed, where as in correlated subquery
parent query is executed first then only child query is executed.

1)Non Correlated subquery:-
============================
Non Corelated subquerys having two parts.
1)Child query
2)Parent query

1)child query:- A query which provides values to another query
==============   is called child query or inner query.


2)parent query:- A query which receives values from another query 
================= is called parent query or outer query.


.In non-correlated subquery maximum limit is up to 255 queries.


NON CORELATED SUBQUERY:-
=========================
        |
        |----------->1)single row sub query
        |----------->2)multiple row sub query
        |----------->3)multiple column sub query
        |----------->4)Derived Table(or)subquery are used in from
                       clause.



1)single row subquerys
=======================
    When child query returns single value then those querys are 
called single row subquerys. In single row sub query's we are 
using =,<,>,<=,>=, between operators.


RULES:-
=======
1)90%    --------->Same column
2)5%     --------->Group function
3)3%     --------->Expressions
4)2%     --------->Different column

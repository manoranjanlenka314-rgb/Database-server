                                 VIEWS
                               =========


1.What is view ? View store data or not? What are different types of views ?

ans:
view is a database object.
Views are created from tables only , its a virtual table only , we can give limited access to the user thats why we are using view only.

there are 2 types of view
1.simple view=>it is created from single table
2.complex view=>it is created from multiple tables.

2.Create a view from emp table with following columns EMPNO,ENAME, DEPTNO
  insert the record into view through base table?
ans:create view v1 as
select empno,Ename,deptno from emp

insert into v1 values(301,'Hemon',40)
  
    


3.Create view from emp table and store only 10th department details?
ans:create view v6
as 
select * from emp where DEPTNO=10


4.Create a view for department wise maximum salary ?
ans:create view v10
as 
select deptno, max(sal)as max_Sal_ofdept from emp 
group by DEPTNO

  


5.Create View Showing Employees with Salary more than 2000?
ans:create view v11
as 
select * from emp where SAL>2000
select * from v11
    



6.What is complex view ? Can you perform DML operations through complex view 
  to base table possible or not possible? 
ans:if we want to make view from multiple tables then it will be called as complex view.




7.What are the difference b/w simple view and complex view?



8.What is differnce between Table and View?



9.Create a view  WITH CHECK OPTION clause on 20th department ?

   if we want to provide constraint type mechanism on views then we
are using with check option clause.it allows only where condition
values only.

                                   VIEWS
                              ============

   
    View is database object which is used to provide table security.
Generally views are created from tables. Those tables also called as
base tables.


      Generally database administrator(DBA) only creates views from tablesand then
only those views are given to number of users. Then only those users are allowed to
view portion of the data through view to base table.


 
   Generally view does not store any data. That's why view is also 
called as virtual table or window of table.

NOTE:-view stores select statement only.

     Generally views are created from base tables. Based on base tables
views are categorized into 2 views. These are

1)simple view
2)complex view (or) join view

   simple view is a view which is created from only one base table
where as complex view is a view which is created from multiple base
tables.


syntax:-
=======
create view viewname
as
select * from tablename where condition;


EX1:-
====
create  view v1 
as
select * from emp where deptno=10;

SQL> select * from v1;

SQL> insert into v1(empno,ename,deptno)values(1,'subbarao',30);

SQL> select * from emp;


  generally in all relational databases simplifying complex querys purpose we can use views.
in this case regularly used complex queries are putting in a view & whenever necessary we are selecting view by using select * from viewname.
  
  in sql server when a view having functions or expressions then we must create aliasname
for those functions or expressions otherwise sql server returns an error.

EX:-
===
create view v1
as
select deptno,max(sal) from emp
group by deptno;


Error: Create View or Function failed because no column name was specified for column 2.


SOLUTION:-
========
create view v1
as
select deptno,max(sal) as maxsal
from emp
group by deptno;

SQL>select * from v1;



2)complex view (or) join view
==============================
  a view which is created from multiple tables is also called as join
view or complex view.
  
  Generally in all relational databases we can not perform DML 
operations through complex view to base tables.

eg:-
===
SQL>create table test1(name varchar(10));
SQL>create table test2(sub varchar(10));

create view v10
as
select name,sub
from test1,test2;

SQL> insert into v10 values('subbarao','oracle');

ERROR:View or function 'v10' is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base tables.



Uses of Views
=============
     in all relational databases views are used in following 2
scenarios. these are

1.providing table level security
2.for simplifying complex queries
